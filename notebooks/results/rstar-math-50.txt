Let's solve the system of linear equations step by step.

We are given two equations:

1) x + 2y = 13 ... (Equation 1)
2) 3x - 4y = -18 ... (Equation 2)

Our goal is to find the values of x and y.

Step 1: Multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same.

3(x + 2y) = 3(13)
3x + 6y = 39 ... (Equation 3)

3x - 4y = -18 ... (Equation 2)

Step 2: Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3 to eliminate x.

(3x + 6y) - (3x - 4y) = 39 - (-18)
10y = 57

Step 3: Solve for y.

10y = 57
y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Step 4: Substitute the value of y into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We will use Equation 1.

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Step 5: Solve for x.

x + 11.4 = 13
x = 13 - 11.4
x = 1.6

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the solution.

Since we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3, we'll do so:

3x + 6y = 39 ... (multiplied the first equation by 3)
3x - 4y = -18 ... (second equation remains the same)

Now, we can see that both equations have the same coefficient of x, which is 3. Our goal is to eliminate the x-term to solve for y.

Next, we'll subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x-term:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This gives us:

10y = 57

Now, we'll solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides gives us:

x = 1.6

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

To answer the sub-question, let's analyze the coefficients of x in both equations. We want to make them the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor.

In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can try to make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3, as previously suggested. However, this would result in the first equation becoming 3x + 6y = 39, which would change the original equation.

Another approach would be to multiply the second equation by 1/3, which would make the coefficient of x in the second equation equal to 1, matching the coefficient of x in the first equation. This would result in the second equation becoming x - 4/3y = -6.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the second equation by 1/3.

Constraints: None mentioned.

This system of linear equations has two variables, x and y, and two equations that must be satisfied simultaneously. The goal is to find the values of x and y that make both equations true.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue solving the system of linear equations.

Since we have two variables and two equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination to solve the system. In this case, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

 Multiply Condition 1 by 2 and Condition 2 by 1:

Condition 1': 2x + 4y = 26
Condition 2': 3x - 4y = -18

Now, add both equations to eliminate the y variable:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
Combine like terms:
2x + 3x = 26 - 18
5x = 8

Now, solve for x:
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. We will use Condition 1:

x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:
2y = 13 - 1.6
2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2:
y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Specifically, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue from where we left off.

We multiplied the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8. This gives us:

2x + 4y = 26 ... (1)
3x - 4y = -18 ... (2)

Now, we can add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate the y variable.

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
This simplifies to:
5x = 8

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:
x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:
2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2:
y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

Therefore, the values of x and y are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have the resulting equations 3x + 6y = 39 and 3x - 4y = -18, we can proceed to eliminate one of the variables. Since the coefficients of x in both equations are the same, we can eliminate x by subtracting one equation from the other.

Let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This will give us:

10y = 57

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have found the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

Now we can proceed to eliminate the y variable.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have made the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 4, we can eliminate the y variable by adding both equations.

Adding the two equations, we get:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
This simplifies to:
2x + 3x = 26 - 18
Combine like terms:
5x = 8

Now, we need to solve for x.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate x:

5x = 8
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

So, x = 1.6.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have found x, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13

Substitute x = 1.6:

1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:

2y = 13 - 1.6
2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2 to isolate y:

y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

So, y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

To answer the sub-question, let's analyze the coefficients of x in both equations. We want to make them the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor.

In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can try to make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3, as previously suggested. However, this would result in the first equation becoming 3x + 6y = 39, which would change the original equation.

Another approach would be to multiply the second equation by 1/3, which would make the coefficient of x in the second equation equal to 1, matching the coefficient of x in the first equation. This would result in the second equation becoming x - 4/3y = -6.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the second equation by 1/3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have made the coefficients of x the same, let's analyze the resulting equations:

x + 2y = 13
x - 4/3y = -6

Next, I propose to subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable.

Think step by step!

In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the second equation by 1/3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue from where we left off.

We have modified the second equation by multiplying it by 1/3, which resulted in x - 4/3y = -6. Now we have:

x + 2y = 13 ... (1)
x - 4/3y = -6 ... (2)

Our goal is to eliminate one variable and solve for the other. We can do this by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1).

(1) - (2) => (x - x) + (2y + 4/3y) = 13 + 6
0 + 10/3y = 19
10/3y = 19
y = 19 × 3/10
y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use equation (1).

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13
x = 13 - 11.4
x = 1.6

Therefore, the values of x and y are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

Answer: We can multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal to -8.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue solving the system of linear equations:

We will multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal to -8.

New Equation (1): 2x + 4y = 26
New Equation (2): 3x - 4y = -18

Now, we can add both equations to eliminate the 'y' variable:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
2x + 3x = 8
5x = 8
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13
2y = 11.4
y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

To eliminate 'y' from one of the equations, we need to make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal. Currently, the coefficients of 'y' are 2 in equation (1) and -4 in equation (2).

To make the coefficients of 'y' equal, we can multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1. However, this would result in coefficients of 4 and -4, which are not equal.

Alternatively, we can multiply equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1. This would result in coefficients of -4 and -4, which are equal.

Therefore, we can eliminate 'y' from one of the equations by multiplying equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1.

Let's continue with the existing reasoning steps.

We have the resulting equations:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

The next step is to add these two equations to eliminate the y variable.

Adding the two equations, we get:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
This simplifies to:
2x + 3x = 26 - 18
5x = 8

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:
x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtracting 1.6 from both sides gives:
2y = 11.4

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

So, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

We are given the original equations:

x + 2y = 13
3x - 4y = -18

We need to multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:

2x + 4y = 26 (since 2(x + 2y) = 2(13) => 2x + 4y = 26)

The second equation remains the same since we multiplied it by 1:

3x - 4y = -18

So, the resulting equations after multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 are:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

The Sub-Question Answer is: 2x + 4y = 26

Next Step: Multiply the first equation by 3, which results in 3x + 6y = 39.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

We have the modified first equation: 3x + 6y = 39
The second equation remains the same: 3x - 4y = -18

Next Step: Equate the two equations, since they both have the same coefficient of x, which is 3.

We set up the equation: 3x + 6y = 3x - 4y
Subtract 3x from both sides: 6y = -4y - 57
Add 4y to both sides: 10y = -57
Divide both sides by 10: y = -57/10
y = -19/2

Next Step: Substitute the value of y into one of the original equations to find the value of x.

We'll use the first equation: x + 2y = 13
Substitute y = -19/2: x + 2(-19/2) = 13
x - 19 = 13
Add 19 to both sides: x = 32

The Final Answer is: x = 32, y = -19/2.

The next step is to multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same, which will allow us to eliminate the y variable.

Specifically, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to perform the multiplication on both equations as planned, resulting in:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

Now we can proceed to eliminate the y variable.

The next sub-question is: What happens when we add the two equations to eliminate the y variable?

The Sub-Question Answer is: We get 5x = 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

We have:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

We add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:

2x + 4y + 3x - 4y = 26 + (-18)
2x + 3x = 26 - 18
5x = 8

Now, we solve for x:

5x = 8
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:

2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

The sub-question asks what happens when we add the two equations to eliminate the y variable. 

We have the two equations:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

To eliminate the y variable, we add the two equations. When we add the two equations, the terms with y variables (4y and -4y) will cancel out.

So, we add the two equations:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
2x + 3x = 26 - 18
5x = 8

The Sub-Question Answer is: 5x = 8.

Here is a rephrased version of the question:

Solve the system of linear equations:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Constraints: None mentioned.

This system of linear equations has two variables, x and y, and two equations that must be satisfied simultaneously. The goal is to find the values of x and y that make both equations true.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to multiply Condition 1 by 3 and Condition 2 by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same, which will allow us to eliminate x and solve for y.

Please let me know if this is correct and I'll proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Your reasoning is correct. 

The next step is to multiply the equations as planned: 

Condition 1: 3x + 6y = 39 (multiplied by 3)
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18 (no change)

Now, it's time to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x.

Please proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This will result in a new equation with only the variable y.

Let's proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now, I will subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x.

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

Subtracting the equations, I get:

10y = 57

Now, I will divide both sides by 10 to solve for y.

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that I have found y, I can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for x.

I will use Condition 1: x + 2y = 13

Substituting y = 5.7, I get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides, I get:

x = 1.6

Therefore, I have found the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Sub-question: What can we do to eliminate one variable (x) by subtracting one equation from the other, now that the coefficients of x are the same in both equations?

To answer this sub-question, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the variable x. This is because both equations now have the same coefficient for x, which is 3.

The resulting equation will be:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

By subtracting the two equations, we get:

10y = 57

Dividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

The variable y has been isolated.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Sub-question: Now that we have the value of y, how can we find the value of x using one of the original equations?

We can use either of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substituting the value of y (5.7) into the equation, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13

x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 1.6

The variable x has been isolated.

(The Sub-Question Answer is not required in this response as it's not a sub-question answer)

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the solution.

We have the resulting equations:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

To eliminate the y variable, we add the two equations:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)

This simplifies to:

5x = 8

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 5:

x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Next, we can substitute the value of x into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13

Substituting x = 1.6, we get:

1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtracting 1.6 from both sides gives:

2y = 11.4

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

y = 5.7

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can write the solution as an ordered pair:

The Final Answer is: (x, y) = (1.6, 5.7)

The Sub-Question Answer is: 

Condition 1 becomes: 3x + 6y = 39
Condition 2 remains: 3x - 4y = -18

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the solution.

Now that we have:

Condition 1: 3x + 6y = 39
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

We can subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x.

Subtracting Condition 2 from Condition 1, we get:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This simplifies to:

10y = 57

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value into either Condition 1 or Condition 2 to solve for x. Let's use Condition 1:

3x + 6y = 39
3x + 6(5.7) = 39
3x + 34.2 = 39
3x = 4.8
x = 4.8/3
x = 1.6

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, we get:
3x + 6y = 39

Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 1 (which doesn't change the equation), we get:
3x - 4y = -18

The Sub-Question Answer is: 
Condition 1 becomes: 3x + 6y = 39
Condition 2 remains: 3x - 4y = -18

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

To answer the sub-question, let's analyze the coefficients of x in both equations. We want to make them the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor.

In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can try to make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3, as previously suggested. However, this would result in the first equation becoming 3x + 6y = 39, which would change the original equation.

Another approach would be to multiply the second equation by 1/3, which would make the coefficient of x in the second equation equal to 1, matching the coefficient of x in the first equation. This would result in the second equation becoming x - 4/3y = -6.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the second equation by 1/3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have made the coefficients of x the same, let's analyze the resulting equations:

x + 2y = 13
x - 4/3y = -6

Next, I propose to subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable.

Think step by step!

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

To advance the reasoning process, my next step is to rewrite the second equation to get all terms on one side:

x - 4/3y = -6
x = 4/3y - 6

Now, I can substitute this expression for x into the first equation to eliminate the x variable.

Think step by step!

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have made the coefficients of x the same, let's subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable.

x + 2y = 13
x - 4/3y = -6

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

(x - x) + (2y + 4/3y) = 13 + 6

This simplifies to:

10/3y = 19

Next, let's solve for y by multiplying both sides by 3/10:

y = (3/10) × 19
y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have found y, let's substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find x. We'll use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides gives:

x = 1.6

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Now that we have 5x = 8, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 8/5
x = 1.6

So, x is equal to 1.6.

Substituting x = 1.6, we get:

1.6 + 2y = 13

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now, let's solve for y by subtracting 1.6 from both sides of the equation:

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

Sub-question: What are the resulting equations after multiplying equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1, and what is the next step to eliminate 'y'?

To answer this, let's follow the steps:

1. Multiply equation (1) by 2:
x + 2y = 13
Multiplying both sides by 2:
2x + 4y = 26 ... (1)

2. Multiply equation (2) by 1 (which means leaving it unchanged):
3x - 4y = -18 ... (2)

The resulting equations are indeed 2x + 4y = 26 and 3x - 4y = -18.

To eliminate 'y', we can add equation (1) and equation (2) because the coefficients of 'y' in both equations are +4 and -4, respectively. When we add these equations, the 'y' terms will cancel out.

The next step is to add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate 'y'.

The Sub-Question Answer is: The resulting equations are 2x + 4y = 26 and 3x - 4y = -18, and the next step is to add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate 'y'.

Yes, we can substitute the value of y into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substituting y = 5.7, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides gives us:

x = 1.6

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next step:

Sub-question: What will be the resulting equations after multiplying the first equation by 3, and will the coefficients of x in both equations be the same?

The Sub-Question Answer is: The resulting equations will be 3x + 6y = 39 and 3x - 4y = -18, and yes, the coefficients of x in both equations will be the same, which is 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next step:

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term by subtracting one equation from the other, now that the coefficients of x are the same?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term by subtracting the second equation from the first equation, resulting in an equation with only the y-term.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question accurately and logically.

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term by subtracting one equation from the other, now that the coefficients of x are the same?

To answer this, let's examine the modified equations: 

3x + 6y = 39
3x - 4y = -18

We can see that both equations have the same coefficient of x, which is 3. Now, we want to eliminate the x-term by subtracting one equation from the other.

Let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This gives us:

(3x - 3x) + (6y + 4y) = 39 - (-18)
0x + 10y = 57

As we can see, the x-term has been eliminated, and we are left with an equation with only the y-term.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term by subtracting one equation from the other, resulting in an equation with only the y-term.

Now, it's time to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x.

Please proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This will result in a new equation with only the variable y.

Please let me know if this is correct, and I'll proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

I'll proceed with the solution.

The next step is to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This will result in a new equation with only the variable y.

By subtracting the two equations, we get:

10y = 57

Now, we can solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to solve for x. We can use Condition 1:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Now, subtract 11.4 from both sides of the equation to solve for x:

x = -1.4

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = -1.4 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = -1.4, y = 5.7.

Let's continue with the solution.

We have the equation -x = -44, which can be simplified to x = 44.

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into either of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substituting x = 44, we get:
44 + 2y = 13

Subtracting 44 from both sides:
2y = -31

Dividing both sides by 2:
y = -15.5

So, the values of x and y are x = 44 and y = -15.5.

The Final Answer is: x = 44, y = -15.5.

To eliminate the y variable from the system of equations, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation.

Subtracting the corresponding terms, we get:

(2x - 3x) + (4y + 4y) = 26 - (-18)

This simplifies to:

-x + 8y = 44

The y variable is not eliminated yet. We made a mistake! 

Let's try again. This time, we can add the two equations to eliminate the y variable.

(2x + 4y = 26) + (3x - 4y = -18)

Adding the corresponding terms, we get:

(2x + 3x) + (4y - 4y) = 26 - 18

This simplifies to:

5x = 8

The y variable is successfully eliminated!

To answer the sub-question, let's analyze the coefficients of x in both equations. We want to make them the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor.

In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can try to make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3, as previously suggested. However, this would result in the first equation becoming 3x + 6y = 39, which would change the original equation.

Another approach would be to multiply the second equation by 1/3, which would make the coefficient of x in the second equation equal to 1, matching the coefficient of x in the first equation. This would result in the second equation becoming x - 4/3y = -6.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

We have the original equations:

x + 2y = 13
3x - 4y = -18

We modified the second equation by multiplying it by 1/3 to make the coefficients of x the same:

x + 2y = 13
x - 4/3y = -6

Now, we want to eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation.

Let's subtract the modified second equation from the first equation:

(x + 2y) - (x - 4/3y) = 13 - (-6)
Simplifying, we get:
2y + 4/3y = 19
Combine like terms:
(2 + 4/3)y = 19
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
(6 + 4)y = 57
10y = 57
Divide both sides by 10:
y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find x. We'll use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13
Subtract 11.4 from both sides:
x = 1.6

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Solve the system of linear equations:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Constraints: None mentioned.

This system of linear equations has two variables, x and y, and two equations that must be satisfied simultaneously. The goal is to find the values of x and y that make both equations true.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next sub-question to simplify the problem further:

Sub-question: How can we make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal to eliminate 'y' from one of the equations?

Answer: We can multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal to -8.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's analyze the system of linear equations:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

To eliminate 'y' from one of the equations, we need to make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal. Currently, the coefficients of 'y' are 2 in equation (1) and -4 in equation (2).

To make the coefficients of 'y' equal, we can multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1. However, this would result in coefficients of 4 and -4, which are not equal.

Alternatively, we can multiply equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1. This would result in coefficients of -4 and -4, which are equal.

Therefore, we can eliminate 'y' from one of the equations by multiplying equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Multiply equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next step:

Now that we have multiplied equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1, we get:

Condition 1: -2x - 4y = -26
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Next, we can add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate the 'y' variable.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Add equation (1) and equation (2).

Here is a rephrased version of the question:

Solve the system of linear equations:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Constraints: None mentioned.

This system of linear equations has two variables, x and y, and two equations that must be satisfied simultaneously. The goal is to find the values of x and y that make both equations true.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next sub-question to simplify the problem further:

Sub-question: How can we make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal to eliminate 'y' from one of the equations?

Answer: We can multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal to -8.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's analyze the system of linear equations:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

To eliminate 'y' from one of the equations, we need to make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations equal. Currently, the coefficients of 'y' are 2 in equation (1) and -4 in equation (2).

To make the coefficients of 'y' equal, we can multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1. However, this would result in coefficients of 4 and -4, which are not equal.

Alternatively, we can multiply equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1. This would result in coefficients of -4 and -4, which are equal.

Therefore, we can eliminate 'y' from one of the equations by multiplying equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Multiply equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the solution process.

We have multiplied equation (1) by -2 and equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of 'y' equal. This results in:

Condition 1: -2x - 4y = -26
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Now, we can add both equations to eliminate 'y':

(-2x - 4y) + (3x - 4y) = -26 + (-18)
-x = -44
x = 44

Now that we have found x, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find y. We'll use equation (1):

x + 2y = 13
44 + 2y = 13
2y = -31
y = -15.5

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 44 and y = -15.5.

The Final Answer is: x = 44 and y = -15.5.

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's propose the next step to advance the reasoning process.

Next Step: Multiply the first equation by 3, which results in 3x + 6y = 39.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's propose the next step to advance the reasoning process.

Next Step: Multiply the first equation by 3, which results in 3x + 6y = 39.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Next Step: Now that we have 3x + 6y = 39, let's rewrite the given system of linear equations with the modified first equation: 

3x + 6y = 39
3x - 4y = -18 

The next step is to subtract the second equation from the modified first equation to eliminate the x variable.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Subtract the second equation from the modified first equation to eliminate the x variable:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This results in:

(6y + 4y) = (39 - (-18))

Combine like terms:

10y = 57

Now, divide both sides by 10 to solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have the value of y, substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substitute y = 5.7 into the equation:

x + 2(5.7) = 13

Simplify the equation:

x + 11.4 = 13

Subtract 11.4 from both sides:

x = 13 - 11.4
x = 1.6

-------------------FINAL ANSWER-------------------

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have made the coefficients of x the same, our next step is to eliminate x by subtracting one equation from the other.

Sub-question: How can we eliminate x from the resulting equations?

To answer this sub-question, let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

Subtracting the two equations, we get:

(6y + 4y) = 39 - (-18)
10y = 57

Now, we have a simple equation in terms of y:

10y = 57

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Our next step is to solve for y.

To answer this sub-question, let's divide both sides of the equation by 10:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

So, the value of y is 5.7.

To answer this sub-question, let's substitute y = 5.7 into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13

Substituting y = 5.7, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Now, let's subtract 11.4 from both sides:

x = 13 - 11.4
x = 1.6

The Sub-Question Answer is: x = 8/5.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the solution from where we left off.

We have found the value of x: x = 8/5. Now, we need to find the value of y.

We can use either of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substituting x = 8/5 into this equation, we get:

(8/5) + 2y = 13

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

8 + 10y = 65

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:

10y = 57

Dividing both sides by 10 solves for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

So, we have found the values of both x and y: x = 8/5 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 8/5 and y = 5.7.

In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can try to make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3, as previously suggested. However, this would result in the first equation becoming 3x + 6y = 39, which would change the original equation.

Another approach would be to multiply the second equation by 1/3, which would make the coefficient of x in the second equation equal to 1, matching the coefficient of x in the first equation. This would result in the second equation becoming x - 4/3y = -6.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the second equation by 1/3.

Let's subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable.

The resulting equation would be:

(x + 2y = 13) - (x - 4/3y = -6)

This simplifies to:

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

Sub-question: Will subtracting the second equation from the first equation eliminate the x variable and allow us to solve for y?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, subtracting the second equation from the first equation will eliminate the x variable and allow us to solve for y.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

Since subtracting the second equation from the first equation will eliminate the x variable, we can proceed with the subtraction:

(x + 2y = 13) - (x - 4/3y = -6)

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

(3 + 10/3)y = 19

Next, we can simplify the equation by finding a common denominator, which is 3:

(9/3 + 10/3)y = 19

Combining the fractions, we get:

19/3y = 19

Now, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 19/3:

y = 19 / (19/3)
y = 3

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(3) = 13
x + 6 = 13

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

x = 7

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 7 and y = 3.

The Final Answer is: x = 7, y = 3.

We have two equations:

x + 2y = 13
x - 4/3y = -6

We want to determine if subtracting the second equation from the first equation will eliminate the x variable and allow us to solve for y.

To do this, let's perform the subtraction:

(x + 2y) - (x - 4/3y) = 13 - (-6)

The x terms will cancel out, leaving us with:

(2y + 4/3y) = 19

Combining the y terms, we get:

This equation is solvable for y. Therefore, subtracting the second equation from the first equation will indeed eliminate the x variable and allow us to solve for y.

Your reasoning is correct. Let's proceed with the next step.

Subtracting the resulting Condition 2 from the resulting Condition 1, we get:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This simplifies to:

10y = 57

Now, we can divide both sides by 10 to solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use Condition 1:

x + 2y = 13

Substituting y = 5.7, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13

x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides, we get:

x = 1.6

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

10y = 57

The Sub-Question Answer is: 10y = 57

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the solution.

Now that we have 10y = 57, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 10:

10y = 57
y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use Condition 1:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtract 11.4 from both sides:

x = 13 - 11.4
x = 1.6

Therefore, the values of x and y are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Sub-Question Answer is: 10y = 57

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-evaluate the subtraction step to ensure accuracy.

We are subtracting Condition 2 from Condition 1:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

To perform this subtraction, we need to subtract corresponding terms:

3x - 3x = 0 (x terms cancel out)
6y + 4y = 10y (combine like terms)
39 - (-18) = 57 (combine constants)

So, the correct result of subtracting Condition 2 from Condition 1 is:

10y = 57

The Sub-Question Answer is: 10y = 57

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's propose the next step to advance the reasoning process.

Next Step: Multiply the first equation by 3, which results in 3x + 6y = 39.

Next Step: Multiply the first equation by 3, which results in 3x + 6y = 39.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next sub-question and its answer:

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term by subtracting the modified first equation (3x + 6y = 39) from the second equation (3x - 4y = -18)?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term by subtracting the modified first equation from the second equation.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have decided to eliminate the x-term, let's subtract the modified first equation from the second equation.

Subtracting 3x + 6y = 39 from 3x - 4y = -18, we get:

(3x - 3x) + (-4y - 6y) = -18 - 39
0x + (-10y) = -57

This simplifies to:

-10y = -57
Now, let's solve for y.

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

y = -57 / -10
y = 57 / 10
y = 5.7

So, the value of y is 5.7.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have found the value of y, let's substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We'll use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substituting y = 5.7 into the equation, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Now, let's solve for x.

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides, we get:

x = 13 - 11.4
x = 1.6

So, the value of x is 1.6.

-------------------FINAL STEP-------------------

We have now found the values of both x and y. The solution to the system of linear equations is:

x = 1.6
y = 5.7

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term by subtracting the modified first equation (3x + 6y = 39) from the second equation (3x - 4y = -18)?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term by subtracting the modified first equation from the second equation.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-evaluate the sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term by subtracting the modified first equation (3x + 6y = 39) from the second equation (3x - 4y = -18)?

To answer this, let's analyze the equations:

Modified first equation: 3x + 6y = 39
Second equation: 3x - 4y = -18

To eliminate the x-term, we need to ensure that the coefficients of x in both equations are the same, including their signs. In this case, both coefficients of x are 3, which is good.

Now, let's examine the operations required to eliminate the x-term. To do this, we need to subtract the modified first equation from the second equation. This means we'll be subtracting 3x + 6y from 3x - 4y.

Notice that the x-terms will indeed cancel out, leaving us with an equation involving only y. However, this is precisely what we want, as it allows us to isolate the y-variable.

Therefore, the answer to the sub-question is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term by subtracting the modified first equation from the second equation.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes.

I can proceed with the next step.

The next step is to solve for y.

The equation 10y = 57 can be solved by dividing both sides by 10, which gives:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for x.

Let's use Condition 1: x + 2y = 13

Substituting y = 5.7, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides gives:

x = 1.6

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

The next step is to multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same, which will allow us to eliminate the y variable.

Specifically, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to perform the multiplication on both equations as planned, resulting in:

2x + 4y = 26

Now we can proceed to eliminate the y variable.

The Sub-Question Answer is: We get 5x = 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

The sub-question asks what happens when we add the two equations to eliminate the y variable. 

We have the two equations:

3x - 4y = -18

To eliminate the y variable, we add the two equations. When we add the two equations, the terms with y variables (4y and -4y) will cancel out.

So, we add the two equations:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
2x + 3x = 26 - 18
5x = 8

The Sub-Question Answer is: 5x = 8.

The Sub-Question Answer is: 5x = 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the problem entirely.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have the equation 5x = 8, we can solve for x.

To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us:

x = 8/5
x = 1.6

So, we have found the value of x.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of y.

We can use the first equation: x + 2y = 13

Substituting x = 1.6, we get:

1.6 + 2y = 13

To solve for y, we can subtract 1.6 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

2y = 13 - 1.6
2y = 11.4

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

So, we have found the values of both x and y.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Here is a rephrased version of the question:

Solve the system of linear equations:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Constraints: None mentioned.

This system of linear equations has two variables, x and y, and two equations that must be satisfied simultaneously. The goal is to find the values of x and y that make both equations true.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to multiply Condition 1 by 3 and Condition 2 by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same, which will allow us to eliminate x and solve for y.

Please let me know if this is correct and I'll proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Your reasoning is correct. 

The next step is to multiply the equations as planned: 

Condition 1: 3x + 6y = 39 (multiplied by 3)
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18 (no change)

Now, it's time to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x.

Please proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This will result in a new equation with only the variable y.

Please let me know if this is correct, and I'll proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to perform the subtraction:

10y = 57

This new equation has only the variable y and can be solved for y.

Please let me know if this is correct, and I'll proceed with the next step.

The next step is to multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same, which will allow us to eliminate the y variable.

Specifically, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Based on the existing reasoning steps, the next sub-question is:

What are the resulting equations after multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1?

The Sub-Question Answer is: 
2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

We are given the original equations:

x + 2y = 13
3x - 4y = -18

We need to multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:

2x + 4y = 26 (since 2(x + 2y) = 2(13) => 2x + 4y = 26)

The second equation remains the same since we multiplied it by 1:

3x - 4y = -18

So, the resulting equations after multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 are:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

The Sub-Question Answer is: 2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to add the resulting equations to eliminate the y variable.

The reasoning step is: Add the two equations: 2x + 4y = 26 and 3x - 4y = -18.

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

We are given the original equations:

x + 2y = 13
3x - 4y = -18

We need to multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:

2x + 4y = 26 (since 2(x + 2y) = 2(13) => 2x + 4y = 26)

The second equation remains the same since we multiplied it by 1:

3x - 4y = -18

So, the resulting equations after multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 are:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

The Sub-Question Answer is: 2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the reasoning process to solve the problem entirely.

We have the resulting equations:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

Our goal is to eliminate the y variable. We can do this by adding the two equations.

Adding the two equations, we get:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
2x + 4y + 3x - 4y = 26 - 18
Combine like terms:
5x = 8

Now, we can solve for x:

5x = 8
Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:

2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2:
y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

So, the values of x and y are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

I'll guide you through the rest of the steps to solve the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Sub-question: What is the result of subtracting the second equation from the first equation, now that the coefficients of x are the same, to eliminate the variable x?

To answer this, we'll subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This gives us:

10y = 57

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 57/16
y = 57/16

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Sub-question: What is the value of x, now that we have the value of y?

We can substitute the value of y into either of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13

Substituting y = 57/16, we get:

x + 2(57/16) = 13

x + 114/16 = 13

x = 13 - 114/16

x = (208 - 114)/16

x = 94/16
x = 47/8

-------------------FINAL STEP-------------------

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can write the final answer:

The Final Answer is: x = 47/8 and y = 57/16.

Now that we have found the value of x = 8/5, we need to find the value of y. We can do this by substituting the value of x into one of the original equations.

Let's choose the first equation: x + 2y = 13

Substituting x = 8/5 into this equation, we get:

(8/5) + 2y = 13

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

8 + 10y = 65

Now, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate y:

10y = 57

Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for y:

y = 57/10

y = 57/10

-------------------FINAL ANSWER-------------------

The Final Answer is: x = 8/5 and y = 57/10

The next step is to multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same, which will allow us to eliminate the y variable.

Specifically, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal to 8.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to perform the multiplication on both equations as planned, resulting in:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

Now we can proceed to eliminate the y variable.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to add the two equations to eliminate the y variable, resulting in:

5x = 8

This will allow us to solve for x.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next sub-question is: What is the value of x?

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation 5x = 8 by 5, which gives us:

x = 8/5

The Sub-Question Answer is: x = 8/5

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next sub-question is: What is the value of 2y?

To find the value of 2y, we can substitute the value of x into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substituting x = 8/5, we get:

(8/5) + 2y = 13

Subtracting (8/5) from both sides gives:

2y = 13 - (8/5)

2y = (65 - 8) / 5

2y = 57 / 5

The Sub-Question Answer is: 2y = 57/5

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

To answer the sub-question, let's analyze the coefficients of x in both equations. We want to make them the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor.

In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can try to make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3, as previously suggested. However, this would result in the first equation becoming 3x + 6y = 39, which would change the original equation.

Another approach would be to multiply the second equation by 1/3, which would make the coefficient of x in the second equation equal to 1, matching the coefficient of x in the first equation. This would result in the second equation becoming x - 4/3y = -6.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the second equation by 1/3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's propose a new sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's analyze the situation. We have the modified equations: x + 2y = 13 and x - 4/3y = -6. We can eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation.

The next step is to perform the subtraction: (x + 2y = 13) - (x - 4/3y = -6). This will result in the elimination of the x-term, leaving us with an equation in terms of y.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to rewrite the subtraction as x - x + 2y - (-4/3y) = 13 - (-6), which simplifies to 10/3y = 19.

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's analyze the situation. We have the modified equations: x + 2y = 13 and x - 4/3y = -6. We can eliminate the x-term in one of the equations by subtracting the modified second equation from the first equation.

The next step is to perform the subtraction: (x + 2y = 13) - (x - 4/3y = -6). This will result in the elimination of the x-term, leaving us with an equation in terms of y.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the solution.

The subtraction is: (x + 2y = 13) - (x - 4/3y = -6)

Subtracting the x terms (x - x = 0), we get 0 + 2y = 13 + 6

This simplifies to: 2y + (8/3)y = 19

Combine the y terms: (2 + 8/3)y = 19

To get a common denominator, multiply the first term by 3/3

The equation becomes: (6/3 + 8/3)y = 19

Combine the fractions: 14/3y = 19

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

14y = 57

Now, divide both sides by 14:

y = 57/14
y = 4.07 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute this back into one of the original equations to find the value of x.

We'll use the first equation: x + 2y = 13

Substitute y = 4.07:

x + 2(4.07) = 13

x + 8.14 = 13

Subtract 8.14 from both sides:

x = 4.86 (approximately)

Thus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4.86 and y = 4.07.

The Final Answer is: x = 4.86$ and y = $4.07.

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13

Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 1 (which doesn't change the equation), we get:

Condition 1 becomes: 3x + 6y = 39
Condition 2 remains: 3x - 4y = -18

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's proceed with the next step.

Now that we have both equations with the same coefficient for x, we can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate x and solve for y.

Subtracting Condition 2 from Condition 1, we get:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This simplifies to:

10y = 57

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Since we now have the value of y, we can substitute it into either of the original equations to solve for x.

Substituting y = 5.7 into Condition 1, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13

Simplifying, we get:

x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides, we get:

x = 1.6

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

We have the two equations: 
2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

Next, we add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)

This simplifies to:

2x + 3x = 8

Combine like terms:

5x = 8

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substitute x = 1.6 into the equation:

1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:

2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for y:

y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

So, the values of x and y are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

10y = 57

Divide both sides by 10:

y = 57/10

y = 19/5

So, the value of 'y' is 19/5.

Let's start by proposing a sub-question to simplify the problem further.

Sub-question: Can we make the coefficients of x in both equations the same by multiplying one or both of the equations by a suitable factor?

To answer this sub-question, let's examine the coefficients of x in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 1, and in the second equation, the coefficient of x is 3. We can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can make the coefficients of x the same by multiplying the first equation by 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next step:

Sub-question: What will be the resulting equations after multiplying the first equation by 3, and will the coefficients of x in both equations be the same?

The Sub-Question Answer is: The resulting equations will be 3x + 6y = 39 and 3x - 4y = -18, and yes, the coefficients of x in both equations will be the same, which is 3.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next step:

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x-term by subtracting one equation from the other, now that the coefficients of x are the same?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x-term by subtracting the second equation from the first equation, resulting in an equation with only the y-term.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the next step:

Sub-question: What is the resulting equation in terms of y after eliminating the x-term by subtracting the second equation from the first equation?

The Sub-Question Answer is: The resulting equation is 10y = 57, which is an equation with only the y-term.

Please let me know if I should proceed with the next step!

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question: What is the resulting equation in terms of y after eliminating the x-term by subtracting the second equation from the first equation?

To answer this, we need to subtract the second equation and the first equation: 3x + 6y = 39
Subtract: 3x - 4y = -18

When we subtract the second equation from the first equation, we get:
(3x + 6y) - (3x - 4y) = 39 - (-18)

Combine like terms:
(3x - 3x) + (6y + 4y) = 39 + 18
0x + 10y = 57

This simplifies to:
10y = 57

The Sub-Question Answer is: The resulting equation is 10y = 57.

To answer the sub-question, I will add the two resulting equations:

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

To add these equations, I will add corresponding terms:

2x + 4y + 3x - 4y = 26 + (-18)

Simplifying the left-hand side, I get:

2x + 4y + 3x - 4y = 26 - 18
2x + 4y - 4y + 2x + 3x = 26 - 18
(2x + 3x) + (4y - 4y) = 26 - 18
5x + 0 = 8

The 4y and -4y cancel out, leaving 0. The remaining terms simplify to 5x = 8.

Now that we have 10y = 57, we can solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 10.

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have found y, we can solve for x by substituting the value of y into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substitute y = 5.7 into the equation:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtract 11.4 from both sides:

x = 13 - 11.4
x = 1.6

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

Sub-question: Can we eliminate the x variable by subtracting the second equation from the modified first equation, and if so, what will be the resulting equation?

To answer this sub-question, let's subtract the second equation from the modified first equation.

Modified first equation: 3x + 6y = 39
Second equation: 3x - 4y = -18

Subtract the second equation from the modified first equation:

(3x + 6y) - (3x - 4y) = 39 - (-18)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - 3x + 6y + 4y = 39 + 18

Combine like terms:

0x + 10y = 57

Since 0x is equal to 0, we can simplify the equation further:

10y = 57

Therefore, by subtracting the second equation from the modified first equation, we can eliminate the x variable, and the resulting equation is indeed 10y = 57.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can eliminate the x variable by subtracting the second equation from the modified first equation, and the resulting equation is 10y = 57.

The Sub-Question Answer is:

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the solution.

We have the equation:

10y = 57

To solve for y, we can divide both sides by 10:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13

Substituting y = 5.7:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides gives:

x = 1.6

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

3x + 6y - 3x + 4y = 39 + 18
10y = 57

The Sub-Question Answer is: 
10y = 57

Here is a rephrased version of the question:

Solve the system of linear equations:

Condition 1: x + 2y = 13
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Constraints: None mentioned.

This system of linear equations has two variables, x and y, and two equations that must be satisfied simultaneously. The goal is to find the values of x and y that make both equations true.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to multiply Condition 1 by 3 and Condition 2 by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same, which will allow us to eliminate x and solve for y.

Please let me know if this is correct and I'll proceed with the next step.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Your reasoning is correct. 

The next step is to multiply the equations as planned: 

Condition 1: 3x + 6y = 39 (multiplied by 3)
Condition 2: 3x - 4y = -18 (no change)

Now, it's time to subtract Condition 2 from Condition 1 to eliminate x.

Please proceed with the next step.

Sub-question: What is the result of subtracting Condition 2 from Condition 1?

Answer:
(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)
10y = 57

The Sub-Question Answer is: 10y = 57

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

The next step is to solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation 10y = 57 by 10.

Think step by step!

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's proceed with the next step.

Now that we have solved for y, we can divide both sides of the equation 10y = 57 by 10 to get:

y = 57 / 10
y = 5.7

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation: x + 2y = 13.

Substituting y = 5.7, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides, we get:

x = 1.6

Therefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

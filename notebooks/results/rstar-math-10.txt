-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's solve the system of linear equations step by step.

Given equations:
x + 2y = 13 ... (1)
3x - 4y = -18 ... (2)

First, we can solve equation (1) for x:
x = 13 - 2y

Now, substitute this expression for x in equation (2):
3(13 - 2y) - 4y = -18

Expand and simplify:
39 - 6y - 4y = -18

Combine like terms:
-10y = -57

Now, solve for y:
y = 57/10
y = 5.7, substitute this into one of the original equations to find x. We'll use equation (1):
x + 2(5.7) = 13
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtract 11.4 from both sides:
x = 1.6

So, the solution to the system is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

Let's begin by multiplying the two equations by suitable multipliers such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same.

Next step: Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1, so that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the existing reasoning steps:

Next step: Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1, so that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same.

Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:
2x + 4y = 26

Multiplying the second equation by 1, we get:
3x - 4y = -18

Now, we have:
2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

Our aim is to eliminate one variable. Let's eliminate y's. We can do this by adding both equations.

Adding both equations, we get:
(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
This simplifies to:
2x + 4y + 8
The 4y terms cancel out, and we are left with:
5x = 8

Now, divide both sides by 5:
x = 8/5
x = 1.6

We have found x. Let's find y.

Substitute the value of x in one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:
x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:
2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2:
y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

The Final Answer is: 1.6, y: 5.7

Here's the proposed sub-question:

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can multiply the equations and compare the coefficients of x. This is a valid step in solving the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue solving the system of linear equations.

Since we've confirmed that we can multiply the equations by 3 and the second equation by 1 and compare the coefficients of x, let's do so:

1) Multiply the first equation by 3:
3x + 6y = 39

2) Multiply the second equation by 1 (no change):
3x - 4y = -18

Now, we'll compare the coefficients of x in both equations. We can see that the coefficient of x in both equations is 3. This is exactly what we were looking for. Our goal is to eliminate one variable (either x or y). Since the coefficients of x are the same, we can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate x.

Let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(3x + 6y = 39) - (3x - 4y = -18)

This gives us:
10y = 57

Now, we'll divide both sides by 10 to solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into either of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(5.7) = 13

Simplify the equation:
x + 11.4 = 13

Subtract 11.4 from both sides:
x = 1.6

The values of x and y are x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning:

The sub-question asks whether we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1, and then compare the coefficients of x in both equations.

To answer this, let's analyze the given system of linear equations:

x + 2y = 13 ... (Equation 1)
3x - 4y = -18 ... (Equation 2)

To eliminate the variable x, we can multiply Equation 1 by 3, which results in:

3x + 6y = 39 ... (Modified Equation 1)

Now, we can compare the coefficients of x in both modified Equation 1 and Equation 2.

Modified Equation 1: 3x ...
Equation 2: 3x ...

The coefficients of x in both equations are indeed the same (both are 3x). This means we can now subtract Equation 2 from Modified Equation 1 to eliminate x and solve for y.

Therefore, the answer to the sub-question is:

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can multiply the equations and compare the coefficients of x.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue from where we left off.

Now that we have eliminated the y variable, we can simplify the resulting equation.

Next step: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the y variable. This gives us:

(2x + 4y = 26) - (3x - 4y = -18)
Which simplifies to:
-1x = 44
x = -44

Now that we have found the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation.

Next step: Substitute x = -44 into the first equation: x + 2 = 13.

-44 + 2y = 13
2y = 13 + 44
2y = 57
y = 57/2
y = 28.5

Now that we have found the values of both x and y, we can write the final answer.

The Final Answer is: x = -44$, y = 28.5.

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x-term. This is a valid step in solving the system of linear equations.

Let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(3x + 6y) - (3x - 4y) = 39 - (-18)

This simplifies to:

10y = 57

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 57/10
y = 5.7

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:

Substituting y = 5.7:

x + 2(5.7) = 13

x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides:

x = 1.6

Now we have the values of x and y:

x = 1.6
y = 5.7

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue solving the system of linear equations. Here's the next step:

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

We can solve this system of linear equations using the elimination method. To do this, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same but with opposite signs.

Let's multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 1, as shown below:

Equation 1: 3(x + 2y) = 3(13)
Equation 2: 1(3x - 4y = -18)

This results in:

Equation 1: 3x + 6y = 39
Equation 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Now, we can see that the coefficients of x are the same but with opposite signs. This is what we were looking for.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's add Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate the x variable:

(3x + 6y = 39) + (3x - 4y = -18)

This results in:

6y + (-4y) = 39 + (-18)
2y = 21

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for y:

y = 21/2
y = 10.5

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let's use Equation 1:

x + 2y = 13
x + 2(10.5) = 13

Simplify the equation:

x + 21 = 13
x = -8

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

We have now solved for both x and y. We can write the solution as an ordered pair: (x, y) = (-8, 10.5)

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use Equation 1:

x + 2y = 13

Substituting y = 5.7, we get:

x + 2(5.7) = 13

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 11.4 = 13

Subtracting 11.4 from both sides, we get:

x = 1.6

Thus, we have solved the system of linear equations.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

Here's the proposed sub-question:

Sub-question: Can we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1, and then compare the coefficients of x in both equations?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can multiply the equations and compare the coefficients of x. This is a valid step in solving the system of linear equations.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question using few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning:

The sub-question asks whether we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1, and then compare the coefficients of x in both equations.

To answer this, let's analyze the given system of linear equations:

x + 2y = 13 ... (Equation 1)
3x - 4y = -18 ... (Equation 2)

To eliminate the variable x, we can multiply Equation 1 by 3, which results in:

3x + 6y = 39 ... (Modified Equation 1)

Now, we can compare the coefficients of x in both modified Equation 1 and Equation 2.

Modified Equation 1: 3x ...
Equation 2: 3x ...

The coefficients of x in both equations are indeed the same (both are 3x). This means we can now subtract Equation 2 from Modified Equation 1 to eliminate x and solve for y.

Therefore, the answer to the sub-question is:

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can multiply the equations and compare the coefficients of x.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Here's the proposed sub-question:

Sub-question: Can we subtract Equation 2 from Modified Equation 1 to eliminate x and solve for y?

The Sub-Question Answer is: Yes, we can subtract Equation 2 from Modified Equation 1 to eliminate x and solve for y.

Here is the next reasoning step:

To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination. We will first multiply Equation 1 and Equation 2 with suitable multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same.

The next step is: Multiply Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by 1.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue the solution.

We multiplied Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by 1, so we get:

Equation 1: 2x + 4y = 26
Equation 2: 3x - 4y = -18

Now, our goal is to eliminate the y-variable. We can do this by adding Equation 1 and Equation 2.

Add Equation 1 and -4y of Equation 2 to eliminate the y-variable):

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18
----------------------
5x = 8

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use Equation 1:

x + 2y = 13
1.6 + 2y = 13

Subtract 1.6 from both sides:

2y = 11.4

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 11.4/2
y = 5.7

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.

The Final Answer is: x = 1.6, y = 5.7.

The Sub-Question Answer is: The new equations are 3x + 6y = 39 and 3x - 4y = -18.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's re-answer the sub-question accurately and logically.

Sub-question: What are the new equations after multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1?

To answer this sub-question, we need to perform the specified operations on the original equations.

The original equations are:
x + 2y = 13
3x - 4y = -18

First, we multiply the first equation by 3:
3(x + 2y) = 3(13)
Expanding the left side, we get:
3x + 6y = 39

Now, we multiply the second equation by 1, which means we don't change anything:
3x - 4y = -18

So, the new equations are indeed 3x + 6y = 39 and 3x - 4y = -18.

The Sub-Question Answer is: The new equations are 3x + 6y = 39 and 3x - 4y = -18.

The next sub-question is: After multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1, what are the resulting equations?

The Sub-Question Answer is: 2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Let's continue with the existing reasoning steps.

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have made the coefficients of y's in both equations the same, we can add both equations to eliminate the y variable.

Next step: Add both equations to eliminate the y variable.

2x + 4y = 26
3x - 4y = -18
-------------------ADD BOTH EQUATIONS----------------

(2x + 4y) + (3x - 4y) = 26 + (-18)
2x + 4x = 26 - 18
6x = 8

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have a single variable equation, we can solve for x.

Next step: Solve for x.

6x = 8
x = 8/6
x = 4/3

-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y.

Next step: Substitute x into one of the original equations to solve for y.

Let's substitute x into the first equation: x + 2y = 13
(4/3) + 2y = 13
-------------------SIMPLIFY-------------------

4/3 + 2y = 13
(4/3) × (3/1) = 13 - 2y
4 = 39/3 - 2y
4 = 39/3 - 2y
-------------------MULTIPLY BY 3/1-------------------

4 × 3 = 39 - 2y × 3
12 = 39 - 6y
-------------------NEXT STEP-------------------

Now, solve for y.

12 + 6y = 39
6y = 39 - 12
6y = 27
y = 27/6
y = 9/2

-------------------FINAL STEP-------------------

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can write the final solution.

The Final Answer is: x = 4/3$ and y = 9/2.

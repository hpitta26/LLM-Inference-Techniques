In this case, we'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we'll multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:\n\n1) x + 2y = 13\n   Multiply by 2:  2x + 4y = 26\n\n2) 3x - 4y = -18\n   (no change required)\n\nNow, we'll add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(2x + 4y = 26) + (3x - 4y = -18)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5x = 8\n\nNow, divide by 5 to solve for x:\n\nx = 8/5\nx = 1.6\n\nNext, we'll substitute the value of x into one of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\nx + 2y = 13\n1.6 + 2y = 13\n\nSubtract 1.6 from both sides:\n\n2y = 11.4\n\nDivide by 2 to solve for y:\n\ny = 11.4/2\ny = 5.7\n\nTherefore, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are:\n\nx = 1.6\ny = 5.7\n\nThe Final Answer is: x = 1.6 and y = 5.7.",
